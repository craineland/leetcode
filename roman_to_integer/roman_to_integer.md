# 13. Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

	Symbol       Value
	I             1
	V             5
	X             10
	L             50
	C             100
	D             500
	M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Example 3:

	Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
	Output: 1994
	Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 15
- s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
- It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].
